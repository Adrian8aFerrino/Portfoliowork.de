        <h3>SUSTAINABILITY has quickly become the priority of modern manufacturing, has quickly become a priority
            within the modern manufacturing world, as the demand for eco-friendly products and processes has surged.
            Alongside an environmentally conscious world, there has been a growing focus on corporate responsibility,
            where manufacturing companies are under extreme pressure to reduce their environmental impact without
            affecting profitability or costs.
            <br><br>
            For the case of manufacturing processes, waste comes in different forms: mainly material or energy waste,
            which creates a necessity focused on understanding waste within and around manufacturing operations as a
            means to generating value, increasing profitability, and reducing waste.
            <br><br>
            Following this trend, new sustainable strategies have become the focal point within the iron and steel
            industry, but it comes with great challenges, as a great deal of manufacturing operations handle complex
            chemical and thermodynamic processes, like those that happen within a sponge iron reactor.
            <br><br>
            Thanks to the integration of data analytics and machine learning models within the manufacturing industry,
            complex operations such as direct reduction can be quantified and adapted to Quality control and Quality
            Prediction models in order to monitor waste production, control the quality of the final product, and
            predict waste generation throughout a sponge iron plant.
        </h3>

        <h3>The challenge for sustainability projects come mainly from trying to understand the nature of waste streams
            and develop effective strategies for controlling production by monitoring the process variables and
            analyzing the quality of the raw materials and the final product.
            <br><br>
            Throughout this project we will use the <b>CRISP-DM</b> methodology in order to generate predictive models
            that can be used to forecast waste generation by identifying patterns through control sensors within a
            direct reduction reactor, and information obtained from material samples taken before and after the process.
            <br><br>
            Within this project, we will explore the concept of manufacturing sustainability and how interpretations of
            analyses and models can be used to control waste production and predict waste generation. By leveraging
            data-driven approaches which manufacturers can then use to identify the sources of waste, optimize their
            production processes, and reduce their environmental footprint.
            <br><br>
            This project addresses two objectives, namely: <b>Quality control</b> and <b>Quality prediction</b> by
            using simulated data that might be found in a typical sponge iron plant. (As a result, all the data
            presented in this project is simulated and is not representative of real-world data)
        </h3>

        <h3><b>STEP 1: Business Understanding</b><br><br>
            <b>I. Quality control:</b><br>
            Quality control is an essential process within manufacturing that aims to identify and correct any defects
            or deviations from the ideal production process. This project is developed for the analysis of data from
            various quality control sensors for the purpose of identifying patterns of quality issues considering all
            elements involved in the manufacturing process.
            <br><br>
            <b>II. Quality prediction:</b><br>
            Quality prediction in manufacturing processes uses data and statistical modeling to forecast the quality of
            the final product based on the input variables and process parameters. The goal is to identify potential
            quality issues early in the production process, giving the manufacturer the opportunity of correcting the
            production before the generation of the final product.
            <br><br>
            For <b>Key Performance Indicators (KPI)</b> we'll take into consideration the value added to the
            manufacturing process when it's adapted to deal with waste production. The KPI's should promote a decrease
            in costs, an increase in profits, and a reduction of environmental impact. (As waste usually represent
            inefficient processes, low quality product or a combination of both)
        </h3>

        <h3><b>STEP 2: Data Understanding</b><br><br>
            Data understanding is focused on covering all activities that may be involved with the problem. In the case
            for our manufacturing project, we focus on collecting data, examining the data and evaluating the quality
            of data obtained throughout all sampling procedures and sensors located within the reactor.
            <br><br>
            Before continuing the project, let's make a short introduction as to what is sponge iron. Sponge iron, also
            known as Direct Reduced Iron (DRI), is a highly porous and metallic product that is the result of iron ore
            that has gone through the process of direct reduction within a direct reduction reactor like a shaft
            furnace.
            <br><br>
            Within the DR reactor the iron ore experiences several chemical and thermodynamic processes such as "Redox"
            reaction, "Gas-solid" reactions with reducing agents, and Heat transfer. These types of processes involve
            not only relevant variables such as temperature, pressure and presence of chemical compounds, but also
            involve physical characteristics that are present within the iron ore and the final product.
            <br><br>
            Before applying any type of data models for quality control or quality prediction, we'll first have to
            understand the scale and range of the data. In this case, the project will take into account the production
            volume, raw material data, sensors within the reactor and quality control records.
            <br><br>
            <b>NOTE:</b> Within this project we won't consider any data quality issues like anomalies or missing data
            as all data is generated specifically for this project.
        </h3>

        <h3>Now let's continue by considering the following available data sources obtained from a direct reduction
            plant:<br><br>
            <b>1. Raw material sample data:</b> serves as a way to analyze the quality of the iron ore material before
            it turns into Direct Reduced Iron (DRI). <br>+ Ore size (cm)<br>+ Iron oxide purity % (Fe2O3)<br>+ Impurity
            1 % (Al2O3)<br>+ Impurity 2 % (S)<br>+ Impurity 3 % (CaO)<br>+ Impurity 4 % (C)<br>+ Abrasion measure (mm³)
            <br>+ K2Cr2O7 content<br>+ MgO content<br>+ SiO2 content<br>+ Unit of Porosity % (Φ)
        </h3>

        <img src="bilder/project_drei1.png" alt="Project dataset 1">

        <h3><b>2. Reactor sensors:</b> serves as a way to analyze the environment within the direct reduction reactor,
            it displays the measurements of the multiple Manometer and Thermometers located inside the reactor.
            <br>+ Temperature measurement 1 (C°)<br>+ Pressure measurement 1 (Pa)<br>+ Temperature measurement 2 (C°)
            <br>+ Pressure measurement 2 (Pa)<br>+ Temperature measurement 3 (C°)<br>+ Pressure measurement 3 (Pa)
            <br>+ Temperature measurement 4 (C°)<br>+ Pressure measurement 4 (Pa)<br>+ Temperature measurement 5 (C°)
            <br>+ Pressure measurement 5 (Pa)
        </h3>

        <img src="bilder/project_drei2.png" alt="Project dataset 2">

        <h3><b>3. Agent flows:</b> serves as a way to analyze the infusion of reagents, binders, and fluxes throughout
            the reducing process within the direct reduction reactor.<br>+ Reagent 1 H2 (L/min)<br>+ Reagent 2 CO
            (L/min)<br>+ Reagent 3 CH4 (L/min)<br>+ Binder 1 Al2O3 (kg/min)<br>+ Binder 2 4SiO2 (kg/min)<br>+ Binder 3

            3 SiO2
        </h3>

        <h3>Agent flows are a very important element to the direct reduction process since every type of chemical
            component has a function to the overall state of the final product.<br><br>For example, the <b>Reagents</b>
            (or reducing gas) react with the iron oxide (FeO) in the direct reduction process to produce sponge iron
            (Fe), while a <b>Binders</b> is a powder that is added to hold fibers together and create a cohesive
            structure of the iron pellets, and finally the <b>Fluxes</b> serve to promote the chemical reactions that
            happen under certain environmental conditions.
        </h3>

        <h3><b>4. DRI sample data:</b> serve as a way to analyze the distribution between the final product and the
            waste generated after the Direct Reduction process, as well as the quality of the DRI final product which is
            measured by the types of impurities commonly found within the iron ore.<br>+ DRI pellet %<br>+ Pellet size
            (cm)<br>+ DRI purity % (Fe)<br>+ Impurity 1 % (S)<br>+ Impurity 2 % (C)<br>+ Metallization %<br>+ Slag %
            <br>+ Waste powder %<br>+ Unit of Porosity % (Φ)
        </h3>

        <img src="bilder/project_drei3.png" alt="Project dataset 3">

        <h3><b>STEP 3: Data Preparation</b><br><br>
            Now that all data is collected, we can identify that variables come from different databases that represent
            different sampling points within the direct reduction process. Due to this fact, we classify the databases
            in different time groups as a way to help us determine the relationships that exists between the variables
            and the generation of the DRI fines at the end of the process.
            <br><br>
            The DRI industrial process lasts a total of 9 hours of which the pellet enters the furnace and undergoes
            the physical and chemical transformation that turns the iron pellet into quality DRI. For this reason, the
            four databases mentioned in the data understanding section has to undergo a transformation as a way to
            adapt to the different time periods.
            <br><br>
            For example, if we have a measurement made of the DRI at 4pm we need to compare the result with the raw
            material sample data that was taken 9 hours before (7 am). By classifying all variables by their time group
            (in relation to the DRI reduction process) we can align all databases in a way that a single pellet of raw
            material can be followed and associated to their respective final product.
        </h3>

        <section class="sample_code">
            <b># Python CODE: Aggregation of data</b>
            <br><b>Starting with the data collected from the raw material sampling phase, we consider that the ore that
            is sampled is compared to the DRI that is generated 9 hours later, which is why the "Date" variable is

            <br><br>try:
            resampled_df = df_reactor_sensor.resample('30T').agg({<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Temperature 1':

        <h3><b>STEP 4: Data Exploration and Visualization</b><br><br>
            Now that the data from all sources are completely aligned it is time to apply data exploration and
            visualization techniques in order to understand the data's characteristics, uncover potential patterns, and
            make informed decisions about which variables are relevant for the modeling phase.
            <br><br>
            A way to measure the strength and direction of relationship between multiple variables can be done through
            <b>Multi-variable correlation</b> which is focused on generating a correlation matrix in order to examine
            pairwise relationships between the variables related to the raw materials, the DR process and the final DRI
            product. In this project we will not only apply basic Pearson correlation metrics but also prove if there are
            non-linear relationships between the variables using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.
        </h3>

        <section class="sample_code">
            <b>Pearson's correlation matrix</b> measures the linear relationship between two continuous variables, which
            in the case of our dataset, it is applicable to all prepared data. Pearson's correlation is commonly used
            when analyzing relationships between variables with continuous data, assuming that the data is normally
            distributed and that the relationship between all variables is linear.

            monotonic relationship between two variables. Pearson's correlation coefficient does not assume linearity
            between the variables, nor does it assume that the data is normally distributed, which is particularly
            helpful if there are exponential, logarithmic or even polynomial relationships between two variables.

        <h3>The main variables we would like to focus on are those that represent either waste (Waste powder %) or DRI
            pellet quality (DRI purity %, Fe % and Metallization %). <br> + DRI purity represent
            <b>Percent reduction</b> which refers to the proportion of iron oxide that has been reduced to metallic
            iron (Fe) during the DRI process, which measures how effectively the reduction reaction has taken place as
            a higher percent reduction indicates that a greater portion of the iron ore has been reduced to its
            metallic form.
            <br><br>
            + Metallization % represent <b>Percent metallization</b> which is a measure of purity of the metallic DRI
            product, indicating how much of the reduced material consists of pure metallic iron. Unlike the Fe % metric,
            the Percent metallization also takes into account any impurities or non-iron components that might be
            present in the reduced product.
            <br><br>
            According to the <b>Pearson's correlation matrix</b>, the variables that have a strong positive linear
            relationship to waste powder (%) has been the <b>Ore size (0.999)</b> and the <b>DRI purity % (0.998)</b>,
            which makes sense if we consider how the final purity of the product reduces the grade of waste produced.
            On the other hand, <b>Spearman's correlation matrix</b> found strong non-linear relationships with the
            variables <b>K2Cr2O7 (0.792)</b> and <b>SiO2 (0.767)</b>, which is interesting as they represent natural
            impurities within the raw ore material.
            <br><br>
            Additionally by focusing on other variables that represent the quality of the final DRI pellet, we can
            identify moderate negative relationships between the DRI purity % and the raw material
            <b>Porosity (-0.523)</b> where a lower porosity means a lower DRI quality. For the case of Metallization %
            we can identify a moderate positive relationship between the Percent metallization and the
            <b>Temperature (0.462)</b> measured within the DRI reactor.
        </h3>

        <h3><b>STEP 5: Feature Engineering</b><br><br>
            Due to the high quantity of variables we will also apply a <b>Multicollinearity</b> test in order to reduce
            the dimensionality of the data introduced to the model. This is done as a way to avoid two or more
            independent variables in a regression model to display high correlation between each other, leading to
            challenges in modeling due to a mixture of each variable's unique contribution ot the result.
            <br><br>
            Avoiding Multicollinearity through the reduction of dimensionality can be done through the Principal
            Component Analysis <b>(PCA)</b> technique that transforms correlated variables into a smaller set of
            uncorrelated variables called principal components without losing information carried by the original
            variables.
            <br><br>
            But before that
        </h3>

        <h3>
            As we are also working with historical data it is important to consider <b>Auto-correlation tests</b> which
            measure the correlation between a time series and its lagged versions. These kinds of tests helps in
            identify serial correlation or historical patterns within data.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, the use of a <b>Granger causality tests</b> assess whether one time series can predict
            another.
        </h3>

        <h3><b>STEP 6: Model Building and Training</b><br><br>
            Quality control and quality prediction of an industrial process is crucial in a sponge iron plant as they
            directly impact the overall production efficiency, product quality, and customer satisfaction.
            <br><br>
            Predictive models can be used to identify factors that are likely to affect the quality of the sponge iron
            produced, such as changes in the composition of the raw materials or changes in the production process.
            + take proactive measures to address them.
            + optimize their production processes through data-driven decisions
            + data on production times, material usage, and waste production rates.
        </h3>

        <h3><b>STEP 7: Model Evaluation and Comparison</b><br><br>
            If defect rates are consistently higher than expected, this indicates that there are issues within the
            production process or the quality of the raw material. In order to evaluate the model we will use the
            following metrics:<br><br>Mean Absolute Error (MAE)<br>Mean Squared Error (MSE)<br>Root Mean Squared Error
            (RMSE)<br>R-Squared (R2)

        </h3>

        <h3><b>STEP 8: Model Refinement</b><br><br>
            By comparing the result of the model to the global benchmark
        </h3>

        <h3><b>Conclusion:</b><br>
            Quality control is essential to ensure that the sponge iron produced meets the required quality standards
            consistently through regular testing and inspections that feeds the data infrastructure with quality and
            reliable information help to identify and address any issues that may affect the quality of the sponge iron.
