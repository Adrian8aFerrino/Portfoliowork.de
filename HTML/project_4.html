        <h3>Within the world of business, demand forecasting plays a crucial role in sales planning and strategy. The
            main issue with accurately predicting customer demand for products and services comes from the reliance in
            poorly built forecasting models that lack the flexibility and ability to make informed decisions that take
            into consideration both internal and external factors that positively or negatively influence sales.
            <br><br>
            Forecasting demand can be a complex task for any type of industry, as it requires a deep understanding of
            market trends, consumer behaviour, and external factors that can impact sales. On the other hand, thanks to
            the advancement of machine learning models, forecasting models can achieve fast and accurate results while
            at the same time taking into consideration every possible factor that might influence sales data.
            <br><br>
            George Box, a british statistician, put it best when he said, "<b>All models are wrong, some are useful.</b>
            " as it is extremely relevant to the world of forecasting. As the action of forecasting is sometimes
            falsely interpreted as accurately predicting something with incredibly precise detail 100% of the time,
            which in reality is as possible as looking through a crystal ball and seeing the future.
        </h3>

        <h3>Most of the time, businesses need to experiment with not only different model configurations and parameters
            but also different types of forecasting models. A forecasting ensemble model is a technique that combines
            the predictions of multiple models to create not only multiple different forecasts at the same time but
            also learn the strengths and weaknesses of each model.
            <br><br>
            Thanks to the advancement of technology, the application of advanced prediction models with more complex
            algorithms is possible with cheaper hardware. Additionally, a smart data scientist or  data analyst can
            approach highly complex forecasting problems with effective methods that are designed to the specific needs
            of the customer.
            <br><br>
            Within this project we will look into the importance of demand forecasting in sales, and the methods and
            tools that businesses can use to make accurate predictions about future demand. We will handle exclusively
            <b>time-series</b> models as it is used to forecast events based on historical data.
            <br><br>
            This project addresses ONE objective, namely: <b>Sales forecasting</b> by using simulated data that might
            be found in a typical B2B company. (As a result, all the data presented in this project is simulated and is
            not representative of real-world data)
        </h3>

        <h3><b>STEP 1: Business Understanding</b><br><br>
            <b>I. Sales forecasting:</b><br>
            Sales forecasting is used for analyzing sales data and making accurate forecasts, allowing sales teams to
            better teams to better plan their sales efforts and make informed decisions thanks to the help of a variety
            of forecasting models.
            <br><br>
            For <b>Key Performance Indicators (KPI)</b> we'll take into consideration sales performance and forecast
            accuracy which help in measuring the amount of revenue generated from sales over a given period of time and
            helps in measuring the degree to which a sales forecast matches actual sales results.
            <br><br>
            For this project we will look into the sales data of a global company that handles B2B products and
            services, where external factors such as supply chain disruptions or significant economic changes, and
            seasonal trends will be considered.
        </h3>

        <h3><b>STEP 2: Data Understanding</b><br><br>
            Data understanding is focused on covering all activities that may be involved with the problem. In the case
            for our sales forecasting project, we focus on collecting data, examining the data and evaluating the
            quality of data obtained through machine learning algorithms as a means to uncovering patterns that would
            be difficult to identify without using statistical methods.
            <br><br>
            Within sales forecasting, historical data is used to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in past sales
            data. On the other hand, market trends like consumer behavior, competitor activity and economic conditions
            will also be considered even inside B2B sales.
            <br><br>
            For this project, we will create a forecasting ensemble model where the combination of predictions of
            multiple models to create a more accurate forecast, in the hopes of combining the strengths of the
            different models.
            <br><br>
            <b>NOTE:</b> Within this project we won't consider any data quality issues like anomalies or missing data
            as all data is generated specifically for this project.
        </h3>

        <h3>Now let's continue by considering the following available data sources obtained from a B2B international
            company:<br><br>
            <b>1. Sales data:</b>
            <br><br>
            <b>2. Customer behavior data:</b>
            <br><br>
            <b>3. External market data:</b>
        </h3>
